# Music with Math

## Overview
"Music with Math" is a Python-based project that explores the mathematical relationships in music. It demonstrates how mathematical principles can be used to generate musical patterns and melodies programmatically.

## Features
- Generate musical notes using mathematical formulas.
- Explore relationships between music and math through Python scripts.
- Includes example scripts demonstrating different concepts.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` and `matplotlib` (for mathematical computations and visualization)
- `pygame` (for audio playback)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib pygame
   ```

## Usage
Run any of the example scripts to generate and play mathematical music:
```sh
python Example.py
```
Replace `Example.py` with any other script such as `Relations.py` or `Mario.py` to experiment with different implementations.
